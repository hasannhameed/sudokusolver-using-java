🧩 Sudoku Solver 🧩
This is a Java program that solves a given Sudoku puzzle using backtracking algorithm. It has a simple command-line interface and can solve any valid Sudoku puzzle within seconds.

📝 How It Works
The Sudoku Solver uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle. It tries different numbers for each empty cell until a solution is found. If the number is not valid for the current cell, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number.

🔍 Algorithm Overview
The algorithm used in this program can be summarized in the following steps:

Find the first empty cell in the grid.
Try all numbers from 1 to 9 in the cell.
If a number is valid for the cell, move to the next empty cell and repeat step 2.
If all numbers have been tried and no number is valid for the cell, backtrack to the previous cell and try a different number.
Repeat steps 2-4 until a solution is found or all possible combinations have been tried.
